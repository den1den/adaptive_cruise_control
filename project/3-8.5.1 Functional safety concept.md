# 8.2 Functional safety concept (general)
Goal: Comply with safety goals
Means: Functional safety requirements on prelim architectural components

Safety requirements are:
- Safety mechanisms
- Safety measures
- Functional safety requirements are mapped to elements in the systems architecture

Safety mechanisms address:
- Fault detection
- Transitioning to a safe state
- Fault tolerance mechanisms
- Fault detection
- Driver warning
- Arbitration logic (To select the most appropriate request on race conditions)

# 8.3 Input
- Item definition
- HARA
- Safety goals
- Preliminary architectural assumptions
- Functional concept
- Operating modes and system states

## 8.4.1
safety requirements need the processes of 8-6

## 8.4.2 Derivation of functional safety requirements
### 8.4.2.1
functional safety requirements shall be derived from:
- safety goals
- safe states
- preliminary architectural assumptions
- functional concept
- operating modes
- system states
