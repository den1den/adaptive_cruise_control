# 8.2 Functional safety concept (general)
Goal: Comply with safety goals
Means: Functional safety requirements on preliminary architectural components

Safety requirements are:
- Safety mechanisms
- Safety measures
- Functional safety requirements are mapped to elements in the systems architecture

Safety mechanisms address:
- Fault detection
- Transitioning to a safe state
- Fault tolerance mechanisms
- Fault detection
- Driver warning
- Arbitration logic (To select the most appropriate request on race conditions)

# 8.3 Input
- Item definition
- HARA
- Safety goals
- Preliminary architectural assumptions
- Functional concept
- Operating modes and system states

## 8.4.1
safety requirements need the processes of 8-6

## 8.4.2 Derivation of functional safety requirements
### 8.4.2.1
functional safety requirements shall be derived from:
- safety goals
- safe states
- preliminary architectural assumptions
- functional concept
- operating modes
- system states

### 8.4.2.2
Every safety goal has at least one SR

### 8.4.2.3 SR properties
To consider for an SR:
- Operating modes
- Fault tolerant time interval
- Safe states (if transitioning will satisfy this SR)
- Emergency operation interval
- Functional redundancies (e.g. fault tolerance)

To get an SR, can use:
- FMEA
- FTA

### 8.4.2.4 Warning and degradation concept
For each safe state define:
- Transitions to and from the safe state
- Conditions for transitioning in technical terms

### 8.4.2.5 Emergency operation
In case "switching off" is not a safe state and emergency operation must be specified.

### 8.4.2.6 Human actions
In case "any human is expected to do something".
In the functional safety concept about these actions the following should be specified:
- The assumptions
- The means or controls

(NOTE1) These action include:
1. Actions from the HARA
2. Actions necessary for safety goals, found after implementation of SR

(NOTE2) Driver task analysis can help against:
- driver overload
- surprise/panic/shock
- mode confusion (confusion of user mode)

## 8.4.3 Allocation of SR
### 8.4.3.1 Safety architecture concept
- Clause 9-7 (Analysis of dependent failures) can be useful to check this
- redundancy and independence concept for the elements
- can be a block diagram

### 8.4.3.2 SR are allocated
> Arash? 8.4.3.2.b is really vaguely formulated

- a) The allocation is based on preliminary architectural assumptions
- b) The SR properties (8.4.2.3) are derived from higher levels
- c) When multiple SR are allocated to an element the highest ASIL shall be applied
- d) (REALLY VAGUE) If the item has multiple systems:
  - SR must be applied to the individual sub systems
- e) ASIL decomposition is according to ISO 9-5
- f) SR on elements outside the scope of this ISO have no ASIL

### 8.4.3.3 Dependency on elements outside the scope of this ISO
If this functional safety concept relies on elements outside the scope of this ISO:
- SR shall be derived for the corresponding elements
- SR on the interfaces shall be specified
- implementation of these SR shall be ensured through specific measures.
- Adequacy of other technologies can be shown during validation

### 8.4.3.4 Dependency on external risk reduction (ERR)
If this functional safety concept relies on external risk reduction measures then:
- SR applicable to ERR must be derived and allocated
- SR for the interfaces with ERR must be specified
- If ERR consist of E/E systems then the SR must conform to ISO26262
- Implementation of these SR shall be ensured (through specific measures)
- Adequacy of ERR can be shown during validation

### 8.4.4 Verification of functional safety concept
The functional safety concept will be verified with ISO 8-9
Note: a traceability based argument can be used (e.g. if all SR are satisfied then the SG is satisfied)

### 8.4.5 The SR should be evaluated
The effectiveness can be evaluated by tests and trials; with prototypes, studies, subject tests, or simulations.
Evaluation should address the behavior of the fault (e.g. transient or permanent)

### 8.4.6 The criteria for safety validation of the item shall be specified in the functional safety concept.

### 8.4.7 Review the SR
This should provide a rationale that the requirements comply with the SG
