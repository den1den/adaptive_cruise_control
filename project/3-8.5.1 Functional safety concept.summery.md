# 8.2 Functional safety concept (general)
Goal: Comply with safety goals
Means: Functional safety requirements on preliminary architectural components

Safety requirements are:
- Safety mechanisms
- Safety measures
- Functional safety requirements are mapped to elements in the systems architecture

Safety mechanisms address:
- Fault detection
- Transitioning to a safe state
- Fault tolerance mechanisms
- Fault detection
- Driver warning
- Arbitration logic (To select the most appropriate request on race conditions)

# 8.3 Input
- Item definition
- HARA
- Safety goals
- Preliminary architectural assumptions
- Functional concept
- Operating modes and system states

## 8.4.1
safety requirements need the processes of 8-6

## 8.4.2 Derivation of functional safety requirements
### 8.4.2.1
functional safety requirements shall be derived from:
- safety goals
- safe states
- preliminary architectural assumptions
- functional concept
- operating modes
- system states

### 8.4.2.2 Every safety goal has at least one SR

### 8.4.2.3 To consider
For an SR:
- Operating modes
- Fault tolerant time interval
- Safe states (if transitioning will satisfy this SR)
- Emergency operation interval
- Functional redundancies (e.g. fault tolerance)

To get an SR, can use:
- FMEA
- FTA

### 8.4.2.4 Warning and degradation concept
For each safe state define:
- Transitions to and from the safe state
- Conditions for transitioning in technical terms

### 8.4.2.5 Emergency operation
In case "switching off" is not a safe state and emergency operation must be specified.

### 8.4.2.6 Human actions
In case "any human is expected to do something".
In the functional safety concept about these actions the following should be specified:
- The assumptions
- The means or controls

(NOTE1) These action include:
1. Actions from the HARA
2. Actions necessary for safety goals, found after implementation of SR

(NOTE2) Driver task analysis can help against:
- driver overload
- surprise/panic/shock
- mode confusion (confusion of user mode)

## 8.4.3 Allocation of SR
### 8.4.3.1 Safety architecture concept
- Clause 9-7 (Analysis of dependent failures) can be useful to check this
- redundancy and independence concept for the elements
- can be a block diagram

### 8.4.3.2
