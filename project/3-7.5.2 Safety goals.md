## 7.4.8 Safety goals
collision = withing 5cm of front car
ct = collision time if car does not respond
act = adjusted collision time if car does everything possible to avoid
So: act >= ct

Safety goal (asil) -> Safe state:
1. Keep safe distance (B) ->
  - ct < Inf => dec acceleration
  - ct < cSAFE => apply break
  - act < Inf => full break
2. Predict car insertions (D) ->
  - monitor left right surroundings and predict insertions
3. Maintain sensor input (C) ->
  - goto full stop (car slowly stop to a stand still)
4. Overridable emergency break (B) ->
  - breaking surpasses acceleration
