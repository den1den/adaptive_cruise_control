# 5 Item definition: __Adaptive Cruise Control__
Car: Nice steering wheel

## 5.4.1 a) Purpose of the item
Provide car with ability to:
- Automatically adjust throttle based on car in front of vehicle
Provide user with ability to:
- Set target speed for car
- Set target distance to next car
And also
- Collision avoidance and warning system by means of breaks

## 5.4.1 b) Non-functional requirements
- Deploy on separate ACU with same CAN interface
- Use sonar and Camera

## 5.4.1 c) related laws
- No bumper sticking = long close driving is not allowed
  - 2 seconds rule
- Speed limit

## 5.4.2 a) Known SR from similar elements
- Breaking should stop the car
- Acceleration should be possible while driving

## 5.4.2 b) SR based on expected behavior
- Accelerate to safe distance
- No unnecessary sudden breaking

## 5.4.2 c) SR based on consequences of failure in expected behavior
- To late break when car in front is breaking
- Sudden shutdown of item should not happen

## 5.4.3 Boundary and interfaces of the item

### b) w.r.t. environment:
?
None?

### c) w.r.t. Req opposed from other elements
Should be real time input:
