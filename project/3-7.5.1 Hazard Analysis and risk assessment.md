## 7.4.1 Hazard Analysis and risk assessment
It is based on the item definition

## 7.4.2
HARA, safety goals and ASIL is based on 7.4

## 7.4.3
Safety mechanisms are excluded from the HARA

## 7.4.4 Hazard identification
> Traceability: Cannot continue without item states, thus generated item states:
- Active + closing in on car in front
- ACC applies brakes + closing in on car in back
- malicious attack
- Standby + user distracted + time-to-collision front vehicle < 2 sec.

### 7.4.4.1 Situations and operating modes that trigger hazards (during correct and incorrect behavior)
> Traceability: iterate over Item def
System states:
- Active
- Standby

Operating modes:
- Active + Accelerating = Acceleration pedal is pressed or not, no break
- Active/Standby + Breaking = minor breaking is applied
- Active/Standby + Emergency = high breaking is applied

All operational situations:
- Car insert narrowly
- Car (front/behind/both)
- Car accelerating in back (that might want to takeover)
- Car breaking in front
  - try to avoid collision
  - stopping for traffic reasons (traffic light, intersection)
- Crossing deer/child/object
- Camera failures
  - reflection
  - not enough light
  - too much light
  - indistinguishable object
  - maliciously reconstructed
  - maliciously jammed
  - Foggy weather
- No clear radar signal
  - distortion
  - absorption
  - maliciously reconstructed
  - maliciously jammed
- Unreachable user
  - Loud music
  - Deaf user
- Distracted user
  - Phone call
  - Tired
  - Talking
  - Searching the car
  - Attending backseat
- Malicious user in front car


### 7.4.4.2 operational situations (to be considered)
> Note: Or are these the states??
operational situations that will be considered:
- Car front + Active + Accelerating
- Car breaking in front + Active + Accelerating
- Car breaking in front + Active/Standby + Breaking/Emergency
- Car back + Active + Breaking
- Car back + Active/Standby + Emergency
- Car inserts narrowly + Active + Accelerating
- Car accelerating in back + Active + Accelerating
- Camera failure + Active/Standby
- No clear radar signal + Active/Standby
- Malicious user in front car
> Removed because its a safety mechanism: Unreachable user + Active/Standby, Distracted user + Active/Standby

> Traceability: added during hazard event identification:
- Incompetent user in front car: causing dangerous situation
  - Distracted user
- Cruising without car in front
- Approaching intersection
- Car cuts: car comes from side road with to short collision avoidance time

### 7.4.4.3 (systematic) hazards identification
hazards:
- Collision with still standing front car (>50km/h)
- Collision with crossing deer at high speed
- Collision with slowing down front car (dv=30,10)
- Collision with car behind due to breaking (dv=30,10)
- Car to full acceleration due to hack
- Car to emergency break due to hack

> Due to Arash article I will also do: analyze malfunctioning behavior:
Malfunctioning behavior:
Break to little
Break to much
Break to late
Accelerate to little
Accelerate to much
Accelerate to late
Warn user to late
Warning does not give required attention

### 7.4.4.4 Hazard events
HTC = Head tail collision
THC = Tail head collision
SHC = Side head collision
DSU = Dangerous speedup (from malicious user)
DEB = Dangerous emergency break (from malicious user)
> Traceability: Go through the operating modes, operational situations, hazards. manually in an iterative manner
OperatingMode: Active + Accelerating
OperationalSituation:
- Car in front (closing in)
  - HTC (>10km/u)
  - 141=QM
- Car breaking in front (closing in fast)
  - HTC (>20km/u)
  - 242=B
- Car insert narrowly
  - HTC (>20km/u)
  - 333=C
  - SHC (>30km/u)
  - 343=D
- Car accelerating in back
  - THC (>20km/u)
  - 143=B
- Camera failure
  - HTC (>120km/u): full speed to intersection with distracted driver
  - 333=C
  - HTC (>120km/u): cruising any of the above
  - 332=B
- No clear signal
  - idem
- Malicious user in front car / Incompetent user in front car
  - DSU/HTC (>120km/u): front car avoids some accident at the last possible time by changing direction, because it's speed is to high
  - 3?2=QM/A/B/C
  - DEB (>120km/u): front car fools sensors and causes emergency break
  - 2?2=QM/A/B (User has to press the break or disable acc to gain control)
- No car in front, approaching intersection
  - Collision (>120km/u)
  - 341=B
- Car cuts:
  - Collision (>50km/u)
  - 233=B

### 7.4.4.6 Hazards outside ISO-1 scope or not?
Malicious behavior is maybe?
