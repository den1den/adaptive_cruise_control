### 7.4.4.1 Situations and operating modes that trigger hazards (during correct and incorrect behavior)
<!-- Traceability: iterate over Item def -->
The operating situation to be considered is limited to 'driving at a high speed on the highway', this is done to scope the project due to time constraints.
These situations are derived by looking at other ACC projects and having discussions with domain expert.

##### Environmental situations
These situations can arise when the vehicle is driving at a high speed (>= 90 km/h) on the highway.
- traffic context:
    - no other traffic
    - vehicle in front
        - vehicle in front is driving manually
        - vehicle in front is using ACC
        - oddly shaped (special transport)
    - vehicle in the back
- traffic conditions:
    - normal
    - road construction
    - congestion (which arises quickly)
    - cutoff by another vehicle
    - emergency breaking of vehicle in front
- ego vehicle traffic action
    - driving forwards
    - switching lanes
    - taking exit (at the last possible moment)
    - approaching intersection
- general hazards:
    - none
    - crossing wildlife
    - road debris
- visibility conditions:
    - good visibility
    - to much light
    - at night
    - fog
    - rain
    - snow
    - flare on the lens

Some operational situations are deliberately not considered, these are listed below:
- Ego car is slipping
- Maliciously attacked
- Distracted user (phone call, tired, searching in the car, attending other seat)
- Incompetent user in front car: causing dangerous situation

##### Operating Modes
System states:
- Active
- Standby
- Collision Avoidance (CA)
- Operational = Active or Standby
Operating modes:
- Accelerating = Acceleration pedal is pressed or not, and no breaking is applied
- Breaking = Minor breaking is applied
- Emergency = Severe breaking is applied

Possible operating modes in the different system states are displayed in the table below.

System states: | Operating modes: Accelerating | Breaking | Emergency
---------------|-------------------------------|----------|----------
Active         | X                             | X        |
Standby        |                               |          |
CA             |                               |          | X

### 7.4.4.2 operational situations (which are to be considered)
The scope is limited to only the following situation:
"Driving on the highway at >= 90 km/h, with the ACC active, target speed at 120 km/h and headway time of 2 seconds"
For the creation of the Hazardous events the operational scenarios are somewhat simplified:
- Traffic context:
    - No other traffic
    - Traffic in direct vicinity of the ego vehicle (front, side or back)
- Traffic conditions:
    - Normal
    - Congestion (which arises quickly)
    - Cutoff by another vehicle
    - Emergency breaking of vehicle in front
- Traffic action
    - Driving forwards
    - Switching lanes
    - Approaching intersection
- Obstacle type
    - No obstacle
    - Static obstacle (infrastructure, road construction)
    - Dynamic controlled obstacle
        - Vehicle automatically controlled
        - Vehicle manually controlled
    - Dynamic uncontrolled obstacle
        - Crossing wildlife
- Unpredictable obstacle detection
    - Perfect radar and vision
    - Degraded obstacle detection (road debris, special transport vehicle in front,
      low lighting, fog, precipitation, lens flare)
    - Impossible obstacle detection (any combination of radar and camera difficulties)

A complete list would include the combination of all of the above categories, however only the following will be considered:

| Name       | Description                                                                                                             |

>Arash: How does amplified harmonic oscillation fit in the picture? The ACC in a certain chain could cause the vehicle to start oscillation maybe potentially going beyond the point ot being possible to avoid a collision with the vehicle in front. 

### 7.4.4.3 (systematic) hazards identification
The functional behavior is determined by the systems overview.
First the actuators are analyzed, then the sensors.

##### Item Intended Functions
The functions of the actuators which are effected by the ACC system:
- Show the state of the ACC system on the __ACC_Display actuator__
- Show the state of the ACC system on dashboard via the __DashboardGPU system__
- Set the car's acceleration via the __EngineControl system__
- Set the car's breaking via the __BreakingControl system__
- Set the __EngineControl system__ internal state

The functions of the sensors which can effect the ACC systems are:
- Change the configuration of the ACC via the buttons on the steering wheel
- Send the car's current motion to the __ACC_Control component__
- Send the detection of objects to the __ACC_Control component__
- Send the pedal values of the acceleration and breaking to the __ACC_Control component__
- Receive positions of objects around the ego vehicle from the __ObstacleDetector system__

##### Item Malfunctioning Behavior
the item should be responsible for preventing the following behaviors:
- Wrong information displayed on the Dashboard display
- Wrong information displayed on the ACC display
- To much acceleration applied
- To much breaking applied
- Not enough acceleration applied
- Not enough breaking applied
- Unintended state change of the __EngineControl system__
- Missing of an intended state change of the __EngineControl system__

##### Malfunctioning behavior of other items
There are dependencies which this item relies on.
The safety aspect of these dependencies is mitigates to other items.
The corresponding HARA is conducted at the corresponding items, resulting in the safety requirements
[safety_requirements/external_safety_requirements.yaml](safety_requirements/external_safety_requirements.yaml)
In short these aspects are addressed:
- No cluttering of Dashboard monitor
- No out of order delivery of CAN messages
- Assumptions about the correctness of the measured speed value of the ego vehicle

In addition the safety of the __ObstacleDetector system__ are seen as a Safety Element out of Context with some assumed requirements from
[requirements/functional_requirements.yaml](requirements/functional_requirements.yaml).

<!-- KLAD:
These are intenal issues:
- Unintended state change of the __ACC item__
- Missing of an intended state change of the __ACC item__
##### Keep in mind:
- Failure of state change of __EngineControl system__
- Configuration not properly propagated through the item (CAN malfunction)
- for example due to broken button: Inability to change configuration
- Missing or late velocity calculation of the car (for example due to sensor failure)
- Wrong velocity calculation of the car (See safety requirement EXTSR_velocity_calc_correct for probability)
- Missing or late object detection from __ObstacleDetector system__
- Sensory failure of object detection mechanism __ObstacleDetector system__
- Wrong object detection from __ObstacleDetector system__ (object wrongfully communicated as being away from sight)
- Missing or wrong values from acceleration pedal received
- Missing or wrong values from breaking pedal received
(for example messages like `accStateChange(st)` can influence more critical areas with the presence of this item)
-->
<!-- NOTE: too specific perhaps:
In more detail these hazards come down to at the item level:
- Unintended values for `s` in `cnfState(s)` message (originating from __ACC_Buttons component__)
- Unintended values for `st` in `accStateChange(st)` (message originating from __ACC_Control component__)
- To high values for `v` in `setAccAcceleration(v)` messages
- To high values for `v` in `setAccBreaking(v)` messages
- To low values for `v` in `setAccAcceleration(v)` messages
- To low values for `v` in `setAccBreaking(v)` messages
- Delayed `cnfState(s)` messages
- Delayed `accStateChange(st)` messages
- Delayed `setAccAcceleration(v)` messages
- Delayed `setAccBreaking(v)` messages
- Missing `cnfState(s)` messages
- Missing `accStateChange(st)` messages
- Missing `setAccAcceleration(v)` messages
- Missing `setAccBreaking(v)` messages
- Unintended `btn...` message
-->

### 7.4.4.6 Hazards outside ISO-1 scope or not?
None is outside the scope of the ISO

## 7.4.7 ASIL granularity problem
The granularity of the list of operational situations is quite coarse.
And during the classification the worst outcome is considered every time so an lower ASIL was not assigned because of the granularity of the operational situations.

## 7.4.8 Safety goals (TODO)
Safety goals are stored in [safety_requirements/safety_requirements.yaml](safety_requirements/safety_requirements.yaml)
and are further described in [3-7.5.2 Safety goals.md](3-7.5.2 Safety goals.md)
