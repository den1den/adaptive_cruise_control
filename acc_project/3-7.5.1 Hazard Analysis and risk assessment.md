## 7.4.1 Hazard Analysis and risk assessment
This is based on the item definition

## 7.4.2
HARA, safety goals and ASIL is based on 7.4

## 7.4.3
Safety mechanisms are excluded from the HARA

## 7.4.4 Hazard identification

### 7.4.4.1 Situations and operating modes that trigger hazards (during correct and incorrect behavior)
> Traceability: iterate over Item def

System states:
- Active
- Standby
- Collision Avoidance = CA
- Operational = Active and Standby

Operating modes:
- Accelerating = Acceleration pedal is pressed or not, no breaking is applied
- Breaking = Minor breaking is applied
- Emergency = Severe breaking is applied

Possible operating modes in the different system states are displayed in the table below.

System states: | Operating modes: Accelerating | Breaking | Emergency
---------------|-------------------------------|----------|----------
Active         | X                             | X        |
Standby        |                               |          |
CA             |                               |          | X

All operational situations:
- Driving
  - Vehicle inserts in same lane, in front
  - Vehicle inserts in same lane, in back
  - Very close to vehicles in other lane
  - Crossing of deer/child/vehicle
  - Approaching intersection
- Slipping
- Following a vehicle at some distance
  - Vehicle in front suddenly breaks
- Environmental
  - Rain
  - Bright sun
  - Very dark
  - Reflections/flare of other objects
  - Fog
- Maliciously attacked
  - Via car in vicinity
  - Via planted device in the car
- Distracted user
  - Phone call
  - Tired
  - Talking
  - Searching the car
  - Attending backseat

### 7.4.4.2 operational situations (to be considered)
- Driving
  - Vehicle inserts in same lane, in front
  - Very close to vehicles in other lane
  - Crossing of child
- Slipping
- Following a vehicle at some distance
  - Vehicle in front suddenly breaks
- Environmental
  - _ObstacleDetector_ system is not able to give any results anymore
- Maliciously attacked
  - Via car in vicinity
  - Via planted device in the car

>TODO As well in revision?:
> Traceability: added during hazard event identification:
- Incompetent user in front car: causing dangerous situation
  - Distracted user
- Cruising without car in front
- Approaching intersection
- Car cuts: car comes from side road with to short collision avoidance time

### 7.4.4.3 (systematic) hazards identification
- Head tail collision (HTC): Collide with rear bumper of vehicle in front.
- Tail head collision (THC): Collide with front bumper of vehicle in back.
- Side collision (SC): Other collisions

Hazards:
- HTC with static object
  - v >= 30km/h
  - v >= 50km/h
- HTC with moving vehicle
  - dv < 10km/h
  - dv >= 10km/h
  - dv >= 30km/h
- THC with moving vehicle
  - dv >= 30km/h
- SC with static object
- SC with moving vehicle
- Malicious control

#### Malfunctioning behavior:
> Article: I will also analyze malfunctioning behavior:

- Break to little
- Break to much
- Break to late
- Accelerate to little
- Accelerate to much
- Accelerate to late
