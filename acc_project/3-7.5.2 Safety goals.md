>TODO: Safety goals are not yet updated after new HARA

## 7.4.8 Safety goals
Definitions and `values`:
- `safe_break:float` = breaking amount of the car which could not harm a user
- collision = car comes within 5cm of the vehicle in front
- `collision_passive:bool` = There is a collision if the car stops acceleration
- `collision_active:bool` = There is a collision if the car applies breaks (up to some amount `safe_break`)
- `collision_emergency:bool` = There is a collision if the car applies maximal deceleration
- `time_distance:interval` = Time it takes to reach the current position of the vehicle in front

The car has three stages of applying acceleration, so: `collision_passive <= collision_active <= collision_emergency`

### SG1: Keep safe distance
Keep a safe distance form the vehicle in front.
This should avoid a collision if the vehicle in front suddenly breaks.
Also the law is respected by the "2 seconds rule".

ASIL: B

Conditions:
- State is Active and:
  - `time_distance < 2 seconds` => acceleration will not be applied
  - `collision_passive` => breaking will be applied.
  - `collision_active` => safe state
- State is Standby:
  - `collision_active` => safe state

Safe state: Collision Avoidance


### SG2: Collision avoidance
Fully control the brake to avoid an collision

ASIL: B

Conditions:
- State is Collision Avoidance
- `collision_active` => apply appropriate breaking
- `NOT collision_active` => revert ACC to configured state

Safe state: full break


### SG3: Maintain sensor input
Make sure the input that the system relies on represents the reality.
This should make sure there is no wrong input for the system such as dirty sensors or malicious jamming.

ASIL: C

Conditions:
- _ObstacleDetector_ gives an sensor error and:
  - State is active => safe state off
  - State is standby => safe state warning
  - State is collision avoidance => safe state blind stop

Safe state:
- off: Turn off ACC and stop acceleration to go to a full stop
- warning: Turn off ACC and display an warning
- blind stop: Do best effort to avoid collision and go to a full stop, then turn of ACC.


### SG4: Intervene
It must be possible for the user to override the operational state easily.
This ensures that when the _ObstacleDetector_ fails to detect an object the user can quickly take control.

ASIL: B

Conditions:
- State is Active and:
  - Break pedal is pressed => safe state
  - Acceleration pedal exceeds current acceleration => safe state

Safe state: Set ACC to standby


### SG5: Override emergency state
Make sure that if the system is tampered with from the front vehicle an emergency break can be overridden.

ASIL: B

Conditions:
- State is Collision Avoidance
  - Acceleration pedal is fully pressed => safe state

Safe state: Turn off ACC
